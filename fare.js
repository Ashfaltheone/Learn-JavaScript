Instructions: 1. Ask the user to enter their age. 

2. Based on the age, determine the ticket price according to the following rules: a. Children (age 0-5) get free admission. b. Students (age 6-18) get a discounted price of $5. c. Adults (age 19-64) pay the regular price of $10. d. Seniors (age 65 and above) get a discounted price of $7.

3. Display the ticket price to the user. HINT: â€¢ Use of Conditional Statements. (https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_if_else.asp)
*/


// Asking user for their age.
let age = parseInt(prompt("What is your age?"))

// Created a variable for the ticket price.
let ticketPrice;

// Using if else statements to categorise each age group for each of their ticket prices.
if(age >= 0 && age <= 5){
    ticketPrice = 0
}

else if(age >= 6 && age <= 18){
    ticketPrice = 5
}

else if(age >= 19 && age <= 64){
    ticketPrice = 10
}

else if(age >= 65){
   ticketPrice = 7
}

// Using alert function to display ticket price corresponding to their age that was given.
alert("You have to pay: $" + ticketPrice)
